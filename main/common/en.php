The event will be held from September 2nd to September 4th.</p><p class='pre'>ICOMES has grown as a worldwide academic society with more than 1,000 participants and eminent representative speakers in obesity every year since 2015 at its launch. ICOMES is an international academic conference that promotes cooperation among multidisciplinary study fields, providing in-depth lectures and symposiums on basic medicine and clinical medicine on obesity, metabolic syndrome, dyslipidemia, and other obesity-related diseases.</p><p class='pre'>The main theme of ICOMES 2021 is 'Cutting-edge Science in Obesity'.<br> Professor Robert H. Eckel, president of this year's ADA and one of the most influential speakers in the field, and Professor Michael Nauck, an important speaker of incretin physiology, will give a Plenary lecture on the importance of obesity treatment. In addition, we organized each session in anticipation of active mutual discussions with renowned experts from various fields.</p><p class='pre'>Upcoming ICOMES 2021 will be conducted as a hybrid meeting that provides both on
		line and offline to maximize the function of the conference while protecting all participants against COVID-19. Therefore, there is no doubt that ICOMES 2021 will introduce all aspects of the latest insights in obesity and will be a venue to exchange our knowledge and friendship to strengthen our solidarity.</p><p class='pre'>Your participation in ICOMES 2021 is essential and we also kindly invite you to submit abstracts for presentation at the free oral paper and poster sessions.</p><p class='pre'>We are looking forward to welcoming you to Seoul.</p>",
	"welcome_msg2" => "<p class='pre'><strong>Dear Researchers from all over the world devoted to Obesity research.</strong><br></p>
<p class='pre'>It is a great honor and pleasure to invite you to the ICOMES 2021 hosted by Korean Society for the Study of Obesity on behalf of the organizing committee. The event will be held from September 2nd to September 4th in Seoul, South Korea.</p><p class='pre'>Increased stay-at-home policy and reduced exercise due to the current COVID-19 crisis are causing undesirable physiological changes in obesity which eventually bring unpleasant effects to the patients with COVID-19 virus. As the world is suffering, ICOMES 2021 will be a significant help to the current pandemic situation.</p><p class='pre'>ICOMES has been hosted for 7 years since 2015 and it provided us a great network to share our knowledge. For another successful event in 2021, we encourage you to come on board and enjoy the opportunity for inspirational discussions.</p>",
